# elDelegator  
## perform email delegation for Gsuite accounts  

### Install  
-  Copy the script available here: https://script.google.com/d/162qqlNzwgewITmJpXoe4p3VsIrGSZYqGDqm4jQhywaaVV31yFLIbfJoB/edit?usp=sharing
- Follow the instruction available in the script to enable it. (create a cloud console project, a service account with the correct scope enabled)

Install process can be tricky as it require you to have a cloud console project with the a service account for which you'll have to activate a wide domain delegation.
A video demo of the install process can be found here: https://youtu.be/AgNPvSI0Z0w

*Note about the video:* This quick demo do not follow state of the art installation, I directly used the cloud project generated from the apps script project. By default it's not attached to the domain from whom wide domine delegation was activated. Thats the reason why I activated both services Admin API and Gmail API in the cloud project. The Gmail API is activated to be used by the delegation function, the Admin API is used because on the UI interface I'm providing autocompletion for the email addresses.
*Seconde note about the first note:* About the Admin API, you do not need to have an admin account to use it thanks to the parameter `"viewType":"domain_public"` it just seems to me that it was cool to use this feature here to autocomplete email addresses. On the Other side the Gmail API is used by a service account with Domain rights, so this one is really sensitive and as I directly wrote the JSON Key in the code well... If you do the same than me do not share your code with someone who you can't trust (I mean it, really!).

### About elDelegator
elDelegator do not intend to be a tool to handle your delegation but more a demo of what can be achieved with the Google Gmail Delegation API â‡’ That are only available through service account with wide domain delegation (you can't even use the API with your own account....).
